'''
@classmethod:

- `@classmethod` is a built-in decorator that transforms a method into a **class method**.
- Unlike instance methods (which receive `self`), class methods receive `cls` as the first argument.
- `cls` refers to the class itself, not the instance.
- Can be called on both the **class** and an **instance**, but it always operates on the class level.
- Useful for:
  - Creating **alternative constructors** (`cls(...)`)
  - Accessing or modifying **class variables**
  - Defining **behavior that applies to the class**, not just to instances
- Class methods can return instances or work with class attributes â€” making them useful for inheritance and factories.
