ðŸ§  What is Early Binding?

Early Binding means that the method or function to be called is decided at **compile time**, not at runtime.

âœ… In Python, variable names used inside functions are "bound" to their values when the function is defined, not when it's called. This is what we call early binding.

ðŸ“Œ Example:

def make_multiplier(x):
    def multiplier(n):
        return x * n
    return multiplier

times3 = make_multiplier(3)
print(times3(5))  # Output: 15

Here, `x` is early bound inside `multiplier`. Even if you change `x` later, it wonâ€™t affect the result.

ðŸ§ª If Python used late binding here, changing `x` later could change the result of the function â€” but it doesnâ€™t!

So, Python uses early binding in closures for variables from outer scopes.
